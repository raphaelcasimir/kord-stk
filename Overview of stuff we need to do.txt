	Something about issues with a stick with rockets in one end. How do you steer and make sure it ends up the right place.
	Find problems that needs to be fixed in order to have a succesful launch.
	
Problem analysis
	Look into all the aspects of a succesful launch, controlwise. Spin control, tilt control (What's it called?).
	Explain how the control is similar to the inverse pendulum problem.
	
Problem statement
	Limit ourselves to 1 control problem.
	How do we solve the inverse pendulum problem.
	
Specification
	I don't know what goes here?!?
	
Product design
	Modeling
		First we need to model the system, how it works etc.
	Control
		Make the actual control system
