Modelling of arm to stick
Have the 5.1a, 5.1b, 5.5a and 5.2b (think it was that one)

Start by putting up equations before manipulating the equations.
Find out if we can solve this by counting equations and unknowns.
Then we say how we'll solve it (we want to find the transfer function).
Last we'll discuss the equation and convince why the equation is correct.
Inverting gravity for example and finding the pendulum equation in this to prove it.

Similarly with motor modelling.
First put up the equations.
Second solve the equations.
Third discuss the solution if it's correct.


Design of controller
Start by showing a block diagram with the actual equations from the modelling.

Tell what the problem with the system is; the zero in 0 and an unstable pole.

Tell more about the options that are available and we only use one of them. Add another open loop unstable pole.

Maybe switch the inner loop and outer pole so inner is first.

Adding a pole doesn't really remove the zero in 0. We don't know what the DC gain would be.
