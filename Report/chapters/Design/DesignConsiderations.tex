The following chapter describes the design of the rocket and its control system. The main objective is not to design the rocket, but to implement a control system that can stabilize it during launch and flight. 

\section{Rocket Design}
For the purpose of studying the problem of the rocket control, a model rocket was designed and built. Since mechanical design is out of this work's scope, the engineering of this rocket will not be explained, but the design can be seen on \autoref{fig:RocketDesign}.

\subsection{Choice of Thrusters for the Rocket}
A thruster is a central component in all types of rocket. In the project the thruster will be chosen based on availability and lift force. The maximum weight of the rocket can not exceed 300 grams and the thruster should be able to lift this. The average thrust of the thruster should be have at least a average thrust of 3 Newton. The choice is limited to the thrusters which can be acquired within the European regulations. Through superficial research it is found that Klima 18 mm rocket motors is legal in all of Europe, and will be chosen for the thruster. The chosen thruster is the version D3-P with the specifications in \autoref{ThrusterValue}.

\subsection{Physical Parameters of the Rocket}
The important factors for controlling the rocket is the physical parameters. These will effect how the rocket would transfer a input to its output. The force of the thruster will not be controlled and is considered a constant.

\end{table}


\subsection{Choice of Sensors for the Rocket}  \label{sec:Rocket_sensor_choice}

This section describes the sensors chosen for the implementation in the rocket. The microcontroller unit, MCU, used in the system will be an Arduino Nano. The Nano is chosen based on its low weight (7 grams) and small size (18 x 45 mm) which will be an advantage when fitting it in the rocket.    

As described in \autoref{sec:PRocketAnalysis}, the rocket can be a system with instability problems. In the inverted pendulum these instabilities are detected through sampling sensors and corrected through a DC motor control system. The same parameters are considered when controlling the rocket. A sensor is needed to detect the orientation and position of the rocket, and a control system is needed to counteract changes from the initial trajectory.

Choosing sensors for the rocket will be weighted based on following parameters:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Compatibility.
\item Power consumption.
\item Availability. 
\item Physical dimensions and weight.
\end{itemize}

A sensor is needed for measuring:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Orientation.
\item Acceleration.
\end{itemize}

Determining the altitude, orientation and acceleration of the rocket can be done with different types of sensor. Two types of sensors can be considered when involving rockets; reference sensors and inertial sensors. Reference sensors have an external reference to measure from, whereas inertial sensors measures changes in its physical state from its inertial state. The sensors that will be used are:
%Commonly used sensors and applications are listed, these determined from different types of rocket applications:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Gyroscope
\item Accelerometer
%\item Global Positioning System (GPS)
%\item Magnetometer
%\item Barometric pressure sensor
%\item Infrared camera
%\item Solar panels
\end{itemize}

%Some sensors can easily be declined from the choice. This is mainly because there application is most commonly with rocket going to higher altitudes or even in-orbit around earth, which is not the interest in this project. For example is the infrared camera implemented in some satellites and rocket to determine the position of the earth relative to the satellite. This will not be implemented in the rocket, because the altitude of the rocket is too low. Equally is solar panels implemented mostly in satellites, because the time span for change is lower than when launching and correcting a rocket.
%Sensors considered in the project is gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometer/compass, GPS, barometric sensor. 
%
%GPS is a relatively common used component in flying systems. It is implemented in many quad-copters, where the goal is to hold a position based on GPS. In the rocket it can be used to determined velocity, deviations from trajectory, and altitude. Precise and fast GPS units have a high cost and higher power consumption than alternatives. It is therefore decided that GPS will not be included as a component of choice.    

An accelerometer measures acceleration in one to three axis(x,y,z). The reference for measuring is the gravitational force. A single axis accelerometer can measure the acceleration in the direction it is oriented, and can for example be used to determine the velocity of an upwards flying rocket. This can also be used to determine the distance travelled based on knowing acceleration and time. In the case of flying a rocket, a three-axis accelerometer will be implemented, as the rocket can move both laterally and vertically.  


A gyroscope is, on the other hand, measuring the angular velocity changes in three dimensions. The difference between the accelerometer and gyroscope is that the gyroscope is capable of measuring the rate of rotation around an axis. It does not rely on a fixed reference and is commonly used in applications like drones and other flying objects. In the rocket it can be used to determine the orientation and rotation of the rocket based on measuring the rate of changes in any direction.  


Combining these gives an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which is commonly used in model planes and quad-copters. The application of this is to obtain the objects position through measuring velocity, orientation, rotation with the gyroscope and accelerometer. 
    	  
Some performance factors must be considered when choosing an IMU. For example the g-force range of the IMU is important. If the maximum ratings is lower than the acceleration of the rocket, then the sensor would not be able to give sufficient data at maximum acceleration. The sensitivity of the accelerometer is also important. The rocket is a system with a high amplitude g-force when launching, and therefore a accelerometer with low sensitivity is preferable.

\subsubsection{Inertial Measurement Unit - GY-87}
GY-87\cite{web:GY80} is an IMU made available for use. It includes an MPU6050, which combines a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope, a BMP180 thermometer/barometer, and a HMC5883 3-axis magnetometer. It is chosen based on its combination of components and low power consumption of $\approx$ 6.5 mA in measurement mode. It is designed so it can be implemented with the Arduino Nano through I2C communication. 
All components on the GY-87 are convenient to implement with the Arduino. With the sensor determined the controller can be designed.

\section{Rocket Controller Design}\label{sec:RocketControllerDesign}
%The following sections explains the design procedure behind fitting the transfer function and dynamics of the rocket with a feedback controller. The controllers goal is to change the orientation of the thruster trough regulating the thrust vectoring system.
