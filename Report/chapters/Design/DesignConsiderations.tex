Considerations about rocket design

\section{Choice of Components}
The following sections describes the sensors, motors and thruster chosen for implementation in the rocket. The choice of each will be weighted in consideration to other alternatives.   

As described in section \ref{sec:PRocketAnalysis} the rocket is considered as a system with stability problems. In the inverted pendulum these instabilities is detected trough sampling sensors and corrected trough a DC motor with a control system. The same parameters is considered when controlling the rocket. A form of sensor is needed to detect the orientation and position of the rocket, and a control system is needed to counteract changes from the initial trajectory.
