%\chapter{Design of the rocket Controller}\label{sec:IPController}
The goal of the controller is to balance the rocket body in an upright position. The system can be decomposed in a block diagram as shown in \autoref{fig:FinalChartName}.

\end{figure}

As seen in the modeling of the rocket and on \autoref{eq:RocketInitTf}, the system presents two poles in the origin of the pole-zero plot. 

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{flalign}
		& H = \frac{F_t \cdot L_{Cg} \cdot \frac{1}{M_r \cdot L_{Es}^2}}{s^2}	\label{eq:RocketInitTf} \\
		& H = \frac{3 \cdot 0.10 \cdot \frac{1}{0.180 \cdot 0.03^2}}{s^2}
	\end{flalign}
\end{subequations}

The root locus of the system on \autoref{fig:Rinitialtf} shows that the poles goes to infinity on the imaginary axis. This means that any oscillations or noise will never be damped solely by adding a gain.

\end{figure}

However the real system is also influenced by the servomotors. The transfer function of the servomotors is shown on \autoref{eq:TfServo} cf. \autoref{ssc:Servomotors}. 

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{flalign}
& H_s = \frac{1}{\uptau s+ 1}	\\
& H_s = \frac{1}{0.04s + 1}
\label{eq:TfServo}
	\end{flalign}
\end{subequations}
\startexplain
\explain{$\uptau$ is the time constant of the servomotors}{\si{\second}}
\stopexplain

This function then adds a pole to the initial transfer function, resulting in an unstable system. This is shown on \autoref{fig:SystemServo}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/Rocket/design/tf_with_servo_vf}
\caption{Root locus of the system with the pole from the servomotors.}
\label{fig:SystemServo}
\end{figure}

This system could be controlled similarly to the inverted pendulum by doing cascade control. By having an inner loop that controls the servomotors as fast as possible the pole added can be assumed to have no effect. This would make the rocket control design similar to the inverted pendulum by having an inner loop with a simple gain and an outer loop where a compensator in form of a zero needs to be added. 

This is not an option as the rocket built does not have any sensors to measure the servomotors. If the rocket was built differently this would be the preferred way to control it.

\subsection{Controlling the Rocket Angle without Cascade Control}
To move the poles to the left half plane, a controller, $D_{rocket}$, adding a zero and a pole on the left side, is implemented to the rocket transfer function. If the zero is placed to close to the servo pole the loci will not be attracted to the real axis. Common practice recommends placing the pole at a location 20-40 times larger than the zero. The zero of the controller is chosen experimentally to be near origin in order to attract the poles. The pole of the controller is chosen to be 40 times larger than the zero. The controller $D_{rocket}$ is shown in \autoref{eq:TfC1} and its root locus can be seen on \autoref{fig:SystemC1}.
\begin{equation}
D_{rocket} = \frac{s + 1.7}{s + 68}	\label{eq:TfC1}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/Rocket/design/tf_with_controller_final_general}
\caption{Root locus of the system with a lead controller, $D_{rocket}$, added.}
\label{fig:SystemC1}
\end{figure}

The rocket requires a fast settling time and rise time in order to act as soon as possible and control the rocket's stability. Lead compensators enable the modulation of the rise time, but impact the overshoot. 

According to the specification the settling time should be faster than 1.67 second.

The gain is selected to be 0.202 as this is where the poles hit the real axis. This should not give any overshoot but as seen on \autoref{fig:stepRocket202} there's an overshoot of around 20\%.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{stepRocket202}
\caption{Step response of the rocket with a lead controller and a gain of 0.202.}
\label{fig:stepRocket202}
\end{figure}

As there is an overshoot despite the poles being on the real axis, the gain will be doubled to get a faster rise and settling time. The final rocket controller then becomes \autoref{eq:RocketController}.
\begin{flalign}
D_{rocket}=0.404\frac{s+1.7}{s+68}\label{eq:RocketController}
\end{flalign}

The step response of this controller can be seen on \autoref{fig:stepRocket404}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

%This value is chosen by observing the root locus and the gain of a set point, as shown on \autoref{fig:SystemC1C2Zoom}.

%To further improve the rise time and setling time of the rocket transfer function until the pysical and specification limits, the gain is doubled.

%The bodeplot of the controlled rocket transfer function is shown on \autoref{fig:BodePlotFinalTf}. The frequency correponds to a complete rotation of the servomotors. At low frequencies a delay is observed. However the system functions at low speed. This implies that the delay has a tempered effect on the system. Higher frequencies are not physicaly possible and do not need to be compensated.
