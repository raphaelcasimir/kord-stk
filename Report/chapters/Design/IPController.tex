\chapter{Design of the Inverted Pendulum Controller}\label{sec:IPController}

The goal of the controller is to balance the stick in an upright position. The system is seen as a block diagram on \autoref{fig:BlockSystemNoControl}. Inserting all the constants from \autoref{tab:IPModelVar} gives the transfer function seen in \autoref{eq:OneGeneralLoop}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\begin{equation}\label{eq:OneGeneralLoop}
\frac{\Theta_s}{U_m}=\frac{-3.36 s^2}{s^4 + 14.11 s^3 - 18.37 s^2 - 259.41 s}
\end{equation}

The system is inherently unstable as it is evident by the pole in the right half plane of the pole-zero plot in \autoref{fig:pzip}.

In order to achieve a stable system the right half plane pole needs to be moved to the left half plane.
\newpage
There's a plethora of different options for the controller to use; the simplest being a proportional controller. A simple way to check whether the proportional controller is feasible is by examining the root locus of the transfer function in \autoref{fig:locusIP}. The pole in the right half plane moving towards infinity is caused by the transfer function being negative and can be fixed with a negative gain as shown on figure \autoref{fig:locusNegative}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{rlocusplus}
	\caption{Positive gain.}
	\label{fig:locusIP}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{rlocusminus}
	\caption{Negative gain.}
	\label{fig:locusNegative}
	\end{subfigure}
\caption{Root locus of the inverted pendulums transfer function.}
\end{figure}

The proportional controller isn't feasible as the pole in the right half plane never enters the stable region even with a negative gain. This is because the pole will always end at a zero if available. The zero in 0 blocks the unstable pole from moving into the stable region.

The controller can be simplified by using cascade control. This means two controllers should be designed; one that controls the angle of the arm and one that controls the angle of the stick. The cascade control system can be seen on \autoref{fig:IPCascade}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{IPCascadeEnhanced}
\caption{Block diagram of the inverted pendulum system with cascade control.}
\label{fig:IPCascade}
\end{figure}

If the inner loop is fast enough compared to the outer loop, it is negligible to the outer loop controller. This means the root locus of the can be split into two separate systems with a respective controller that needs to be designed. The two new loops will be referred to as the inner loop and outer loop and their transfer function is seen in \autoref{eq:InnerOuterTF}.
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:InnerOuterTF}
	\begin{flalign}
		\frac{\Theta_a}{U_m}&= \frac{5.43}{s^2 + 14.11 s} \\
		\frac{\Theta_s}{\Theta_a}&=\frac{-0.62 s^2}{s^2 - 18.38}
	\end{flalign}
\end{subequations}

The root locus of the two subsystems is seen on \autoref{fig:locusSplit}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{rlocusVArmAlt}
	\caption{Inner loop.}
	\label{fig:locusVArm}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{rlocusArmStick}
	\caption{Outer loop with negative gain.}
	\end{subfigure}
\caption{Root locus of the inverted pendulum with cascade control.}
\label{fig:locusSplit}
\end{figure}

With this split it's simpler to design a controller that can move the unstable pole to the stable region. The inner loop controller will be designed first as it's essential to this split that the inner loop is faster than the outer loop. The inner loop controller will be designed to be as fast as possible before the outer loop controller is designed.
%\newpage
\section{Design of Inner Loop Controller}
For the design of the inner loop controller, it is important that it settles faster than the outer loop controller without any overshoot. This means the natural frequency of the system with the controller needs to be larger and the poles close to the real axis. With the help of \autoref{fig:VArmGeneralPControllerRLocus} a gain of 9.17 is chosen as it is the maximum gain obtainable without having any overshoot.
\begin{figure} [htbp] 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{rlocusVArmGeneralPController.eps}
	\caption{Root locus of the inner loop showing the gain required for the poles to meet.}
	\label{fig:VArmGeneralPControllerRLocus}
\end{figure}

However this system the two poles are still very close to the outer loop system. 
%This supposition is confirmed by the step response seen in \autoref{fig:VArmGeneralPControllerStepResp}.
%\begin{figure}[htbp] 
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{rlocusVArmGeneralPControllerStepResp.eps}
%	\caption{Step response of the arm with the voltage as the input}
%	\label{fig:VArmGeneralPControllerStepResp}
%\end{figure}

In order to speed up the inner loop two options are available. The first one is to use a more elaborate controller than the P controller such as a PD controller or a lead. The second one is to once again divide the inner loop into two loops. The second method is as the motor has already a tachometer integrated, and it is simpler to implement this method. Furthermore when testing for the motor parameters, the driver did not deliver a constant speed for a constant voltage. A feedback loop of the velocity would be able to reduce the inconsistencies generated by the driver. 

The two new loops will thus control the motor velocity and angle of the arm and will be called motor loop and arm loop respectively.
%The two new loops are respectively the voltage as the input and the velocity as the output which will be called motor loop from now on, and the velocity as the input and the arm's angle as the output named as arm's loop.

The first loop which will be designed will be the motor loop as it is the most inner loop. The new control loop is added to \autoref{fig:IPCascade} to form the final block diagram presented in \autoref{fig:BlockAllLoops}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{BlockAllLoops}
	\caption{New block diagram of the inverted pendulum system with cascade control.}
	\label{fig:BlockAllLoops}
\end{figure}

\input{chapters/Design/MotorLoop.tex}

\subsection{Design of the Arm Loop Controller}

The motor loop part has a settling time of \SI{0.0137}{\second}, so the settling time of the arm's loop has to be at least \SI{0.137}{\second} in order to make the assumption that the motor's loop transfer function is equal to 1 for the arm's loop. The transfer function for the arm loop is found by inserting the values in \autoref{eq:thetaOmega} giving \autoref{eq:WArmLoop}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:WArmLoop}
	\frac{\Theta_a}{\Omega_m}=\frac{0.027}{s}
\end{equation}

The root locus of \autoref{eq:WArmLoop}, in \autoref{fig:WArmLoopRLocus}, shows that there is theoretically no gain limitation for the arm as the pole moves to the left side plan making the system stable, as long as the gain is high enough. The pole is also always on the real axis which means there will be no overshoot no matter the gain.
\begin{figure} [htbp] 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{WArmPControllerRLocus.eps}
	\caption{Velocity as input and Arm's angle as the output}
	\label{fig:WArmLoopRLocus}
\end{figure}

The gain for the closed loop will be chosen to give a settling time slower than 0.137. A gain of 900 is satisfactory as it gives a settling time of 0.16 seconds as seen on the step response on \autoref{fig:WArmLoopStepResp}.
\begin{figure} [htbp] 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{WArmPControllerStepResp.eps}
	\caption{Step response of the closed arm loop with a gain of 900.}
	\label{fig:WArmLoopStepResp}
\end{figure}
\newpage

%By moving the zero further into the left half plane gives a faster settling time but requires a higher gain and a faster sampling rate for a digital controller. Having a higher gain can give issues with saturating the motor and there may be limits from the sampling rate with very fast settling times. 

The arm loop controller then becomes \autoref{eq:ArmLoopController}.
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:ArmLoopController}
D_{arm}=900
\end{flalign}
\section{Design of Outer Loop Controller}
As the poles in feedback will eventually end up at the zeros with a large enough gain, there are two options to bring the unstable pole into the stable region: Remove all zeros in 0 so the pole can cross the into the stable region along the real axis or add another unstable open loop pole to force the poles off the real axis and then try to circumvent the zeros in 0. 

Removing the zeros in 0 can't be done by adding poles as $\infty \cdot 0$ isn't defined. Instead it's better to try and redefine the model output to something with a DC gain but at the same time requires the stick to be balanced to achieve the new output. This could be by attempting to control the position of a point on the stick. The stick would need to be balanced in order to have the point always be in the correct position.

%Cancelling zeros in 0 by adding poles can be dangerous as the steady state error will no longer be zero which is critical for a stable inverted pendulum. The system is difficult to control as the transfer function was derived with an attempt to control the angle of the stick. This is only really possible in the special case where the reference is exactly 0 at all times. The system can instead be redefined as trying to control the position of a point on the stick in relation to the vertical axis. By controlling the position instead of the angle would mean the system would still have to balance the stick but not be forced to use a reference of 0 at all times. This could make the system easier to control.

\subsection{Redefining the Inverted Pendulums Output}
The inverted pendulum model will be redefined so the output is the distance from a point on the stick to the vertical axis instead of the angle of the stick. The point, $\alpha$, and the distance to the vertical axis, $x_\alpha$, are seen on \autoref{fig:modelDist}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{ModelDistAlpha}
\caption{Diagram of the distance that will be controlled instead of the angle of the stick.}
\label{fig:modelDist}
\end{figure}

The distance to the point can be described by \autoref{eq:xa}.
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:xa}
& x_\alpha(t) = l_a\sin(\theta_a(t))+l_\alpha\sin(\theta_s(t))
\end{flalign}
This is not a linear equation and needs to be linearized in order to Laplace transform it. This is done with a 1st order Taylor approximation around the equilibrium where $\theta_a=\theta_s=0$ in \autoref{eq:xaTaylor}
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:xaTaylor}
\begin{flalign}
& x_\alpha(t)\approx l_a\sin(0)+l_a\cos(0)\theta_a(t)+l_\alpha\sin(0)+l_\alpha\cos(0)\theta_s(t) \\
& x_\alpha(t)\approx l_a\theta_a(t)+l_\alpha\theta_s(t)
\end{flalign}
\end{subequations}
This will then be Laplace transformed in \autoref{eq:xaLaplace}.
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:xaLaplace}
X_\alpha(s)=l_a\Theta_a(s)+l_\alpha\Theta_s(s) 
\end{flalign}

By isolating $\Theta_s(s)$ in \autoref{eq:tfArmStick} and inserting it into \autoref{eq:xaLaplace}, the transfer function in \eqref{eq:xatf} is found. The friction part is removed per \autoref{tab:IPModelVar}.

\begin{subequations}
\begin{flalign}
& X_\alpha(s)=l_a\Theta_a(s)+l_\alpha\frac{-\frac{3l_a}{2l_s}s^2}{s^2-\frac{3g}{2l_s}}\Theta_a(s) \\
& X_\alpha(s)=\frac{l_a\left(s^2-\frac{3g}{2l_s}\right)+l_\alpha\left(-\frac{3l_a}{2l_s}s^2\right)}{s^2-\frac{3g}{2l_s}}\Theta_a(s) \\
& \frac{X_\alpha(s)}{\Theta_a(s)} = \frac{s^2\left(l_a-l_\alpha\frac{3l_a}{2l_s}\right)-l_a\frac{3g}{2l_s}}{s^2-\frac{3g}{2l_s}} \label{eq:xatf}
\end{flalign}
\end{subequations}
The transfer function still ends up with 2 zeros but it's possible to remove them by selecting the point $\alpha$ so $l_\alpha=\frac{2l_s}{3}$. Inserting this into \autoref{eq:xatf} the transfer function becomes \autoref{eq:xaTF}.
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:xaTF}
& \frac{X_\alpha(s)}{\Theta_a(s)} = \frac{-l_a\frac{3g}{2l_s}}{s^2-\frac{3g}{2l_s}}
\end{flalign}

The zeros in 0 has been removed but the distance, $x_\alpha$, now needs to be measured for the feedback. This can be done by measuring the angles, which was also necessary before, but now use \autoref{eq:xa} to calculate the distance instead of using the angle directly. The controller for the transfer function in \autoref{eq:xaTF} can now be designed.
\subsection{Controlling the Distance from the Stick to Vertical}
%The controller for the system will be split into two. One controller in an inner loop that controls the angle of the arm and one in an outer loop that controls the position of the stick. The system with the two controllers can be seen on the block diagram on \autoref{fig:IPBlock}.
%
The new block diagram for the controllers can be seen on \autoref{fig:IPBlock}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{IPBlock}
\caption{Block diagram of the inverted pendulum system with inner and outer loop controllers.}
\label{fig:IPBlock}
\end{figure}
%
%If the inner loop is faster than the outer loop then it can be assumed to be irrelevant when designing the outer loop controller.

With the redefined transfer function the outer loop will control the transfer function in \autoref{eq:xaTF}. From the root locus in \autoref{fig:locusxa} it can be seen that a zero needs to be added on the real axis in the left half plane in order to move the pole in the right half plane to the stable region. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{rlocusRedef}
\caption{Root locus of the transfer function from the angle of the arm to the position of a point on the stick.}
\label{fig:locusxa}
\end{figure}

If the zero is positioned between the two poles both the right most will move towards the zero while the leftmost moves towards infinity; both along the real axis. Positioning the zero close to the origin doesn't allow for the pole to move far into the left half plane. If it's put far to the left of the stable pole the poles will move off the real axis and to the left of the zero with higher gain. This can move them very far into the left half plane before they come back to the real axis which could cause issues for making the inner loop faster than the outer loop. This is because the further away the poles are from origin the higher the natural frequency and a high natural frequency means small settling time. If the poles are off the real axis it'll introduce overshoot which needs to be under 10\% per the specifications. 

Placing the zero close to the leftmost pole would allow for the unstable pole to move further into the left half plane without an overly fast response or any overshoot. 

The zero could theoretically be placed on the pole to cancel it and allow the pole to move further into the left half plane along the real axis. This would be ideal but the true location of the pole of the real system is difficult to find as small variations in measurements of the system could move the pole slightly. 

The zero will initially be placed on the pole as it doesn't change the system drastically whether it's slightly off to either side. The pole is then placed at $-\sqrt{\frac{3g}{2l_s}}$. This can be seen in \autoref{fig:rlocusZeroAdded}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{rlocusZeroAdded}
\caption{Root locus of the outer loop system with a zero cancelling the left pole.}
\label{fig:rlocusZeroAdded}
\end{figure}

The unstable pole can now enter the stable region by selecting a gain large enough. Simply adding a zero to the system will however amplify high frequencies. This can be avoided by adding a pole further into the left half plane. This effectively makes the controller a lead controller. The position of the pole and the gain will determine the settling time and overshoot of the system. The settling time for the outer loop controller should be more than 10 times slower so the assumption, that the inner loop controller is much faster than the outer loop controller, holds true. As the gain increases the two poles move closer to each each other before meeting and moving into the imaginary plane. The gain will be selected to be however much is needed for the poles to meet. The pole can then be selected such that the place where the poles meet will give a settling time 10 times slower than the inner loop.

As the settling time of the inner loop is 0.16 seconds, the natural frequency of the outer loop can be approximated by \autoref{eq:outerWn}. 
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:outerWn}
\begin{flalign}
T_{s_{outer}}(2\%) &=-\frac{\ln(0.02)}{\zeta\cdot \omega_n} \\
\omega_n &=-\frac{\ln(0.02)}{\zeta\cdot T_{s_{inner}}\cdot 10} \\
\omega_n &=-\frac{\ln(0.02)}{1\cdot 0.16 \cdot 10} \\
\omega_n &=2.45
\end{flalign}
\end{subequations}

This approximation only holds true for 2nd order systems without zeros which this would only be if the zero placed exactly on the pole removes both. This is not the case however it is still a good place to start.
To achieve a natural frequency of 2.45, the lead controller pole needs to be placed so the halfway point between it and the unstable pole is -2.45. The pole location is then found by \autoref{eq:outerLeadPole}.
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:outerLeadPole}
\begin{flalign}
-2.45&=\frac{p_{unstable}+p_{lead}}{2} \\
p_{lead} &=-2.45\cdot 2-\sqrt{\frac{3g}{2l_s}} \\
p_{lead} &=-9.19 
\end{flalign}
\end{subequations}

This can be seen on \autoref{fig:rlocusLead}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{rlocusOuterLead}
\caption{Root locus of the outer loop with the lead controller.}
\label{fig:rlocusLead}
\end{figure}

To make the two poles meet a gain of 7.48 is needed. This gives a lead controller of \autoref{eq:IPLead}.
\begin{flalign}
D_{x}=7.48\frac{s+\sqrt{\frac{3g}{2l_s}}}{s+9.19}\label{eq:IPLead}
\end{flalign}

The settling time is found by looking at the step response on \autoref{fig:stepOuterLead}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{stepOuterLoop}
\caption{Step response showing the settling time of the outer loop with a lead controller.}
\label{fig:stepOuterLead}
\end{figure}

The settling time is slower than the 1.6 seconds that was expected and this is because the zero placed on the pole still has an influence on the system. A bit of overshoot can also be added in this system to get a faster rise time but a similar settling time. This is okay as the specifications are only for overshoot of the angle of the stick. It's uncertain how an overshoot when controlling the distance to a point on the stick will affect the angle of the stick. A maximum overshoot for the distance is therefore arbitrarily chosen to be the same as the overshoot for the angle.
To get a settling time of 1.6 seconds a new gain needs to be found to give a faster settling time but no more than 10\% overshoot. If it's not possible without more than 10\% overshoot the controller pole has to be moved further to the left

The lead controller then becomes \autoref{eq:outerLeadController}.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{flalign}
D_x&=8.8\frac{s+\sqrt{\frac{3g}{2l_s}}}{s+2\frac{\ln(0.02)}{1.6}+\sqrt{\frac{3g}{2l_s}}} \\ 
D_x&=8.8\frac{s+4.29}{s+9.19} \label{eq:outerLeadController}
\end{flalign}
\end{subequations}

This controller gives a fast rise time, a settling time of 1.61 seconds and overshoot of less than 10\%. This can be seen on the step response on \autoref{fig:stepOuterLeadOvershoot}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{stepOuterOvershoot}
\caption{Step response of the outer loop with the lead controller that gives less than 10\% of overshoot.}
\label{fig:stepOuterLeadOvershoot}
\end{figure}
\newpage

\section{Verifying the total controller}
The final controller consists of the motor loop controller, the arm loop controller and the outer loop controller and are seen in \autoref{eq:FinalController}.
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:FinalController}
\begin{flalign}
&D_{motor}=1.35 \\
&D_{arm}=900 \\
&D_x=8.8\frac{s+4.29}{s+9.19}
\end{flalign}
\end{subequations}

These are implemented as shown on \autoref{fig:BlockAllLoops} and the entire system has the pole-zero plot on \autoref{fig:finalpzip} which shows it should be stable as all poles are in the left half plane.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}

	\caption{Close.}
	\end{subfigure}
\caption{Pole-zero plot of the final inverted pendulum system.}
\label{fig:finalpzip}
\end{figure}

The step response for the inverted pendulum with the final controller is seen on \autoref{fig:finalStep}.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{finalStep}
\caption{Step response of the inverted pendulum with the final controller.}
\label{fig:finalStep}
\end{figure}

The controller has a settling time of 3.15 seconds and shows it can balance a point on the stick sufficiently. The controller is deemed satisfactory and will be implemented.
