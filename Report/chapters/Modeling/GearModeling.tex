\section{Modeling of the Gear System}
In this section, the gear system will be modeled.

Three transfer functions are going to be determined in this section. First, the transfer of the motor's angular velocity $\omega_m$ to the angle of the arm $\theta_a$ through the gears. Then, too transfer functions are needed for $\tau_L$: the torque of the load comes from both the torque of the arm and stick $\tau_{as}$ and, considering the frictions in the gears, from $\omega_m$ itself.

\subsection{Linear Model}
\todo[inline,author=Geoff]{Why linear model?}

\subsubsection*{Relation between $\Omega_m$ and $\Theta_a$}
Ratio between small wheel x, $n_x$, and big wheel x, $N_x$ is the same:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{n_x}{N_x} = \frac{n_{motor}}{N_{w_1}}
\end{equation}
