\chapter{Conclusion}
An analysis was made to determine whether the inverted pendulum and rocket models could be controlled by the same controller. The mathematical models were not similar and a different controller for each system is thus necessary. 

A controller was made for the inverted pendulum using cascade control to simplify the setup along with redefining the model to simplify it further. A lead controller was made to achieve a stable system and all controllers were implemented on an Arduino. The acceptance tests showed that the combination of cascade control and a lead controller could balance the stick in a satisfactory fashion despite not controlling the angle of the stick directly. This showed that it is not only important to design a precise controller but also important to choose the feedback wisely.

The rocket was not made readily available by the university and needed to be built. A controller was designed with the same procedure as the inverted pendulum and it could theoretically control the rocket trajectory. It was, however, ultimately not tested as the rocket design and implementation was not ready in time for a proper test. A video was taken that showcases the principle of the small scale rocket using the controller designed by tilting the rocket manually. Given more time a test with the thruster attached and the rocket held in place would be made to check if the design satisfy the requirements.
