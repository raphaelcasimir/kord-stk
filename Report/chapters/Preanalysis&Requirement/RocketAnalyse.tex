\chapter{Preliminary Analysis of a Rocket}
The following chapter describes the functionality and structure behind a rocket. The goal is to determine which factors that leads to instability in flight and launch of a rocket. 
\bigbreak

The rocket which will described as based on:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item A payload system.
\item A guidance system to control the rocket.
\item A propulsion system to launch the rocket with. 
\item Structure system consisting of nose cone, frame and fins.
\end{itemize}
