\chapter{Requirements and Specifications}
The following chapter describes requirements and specifications that is determined for controlling both the rocket and the inverted pendulum. The requirements is set to obtain a system which fulfils the problem statement \todo{Ref to section - Mathias and might be changed in formulation}.

As described earlier the goal of both systems is to react to deviations from its stable position. The goal of the rocket is the launch and fly stable and straight versus the inverted pendulum where the goal is to balance the stick in vertical upwards position.  

Both systems will be described with physical and control requirements in separate sections. The physical requirements will be set based on the limits of the models. Where the requirements for the controllers will be set based on the approximations of best possible control parameters for each model.  
The controller requirements will be approximated based on speed, precision and stability. Each parameter would affect each other, and therefore a discussion of the best combination of them will be considered.
