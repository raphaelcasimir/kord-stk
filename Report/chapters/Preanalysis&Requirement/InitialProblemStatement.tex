\chapter{Initial Problem Statement}
In order to compare the inverted pendulum a rocket the following thesis questions are set: 

\textit{To what degree is the stabilization of the inverted pendulum similar to the flight control of a rocket?}
\bigbreak
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Is the model of the inverted pendulum similar to the rocket's flight control?
\item Can the inverted pendulum and the rocket be stabilized using similar control methods?
\end{itemize}


These questions lead to a preliminary analysis of both systems models in order to examine their similarities.
