\chapter{Initial Problem Statement}
In order to design and implement a controller that can ensure a stable launch and flight of a rocket the following questions needs answering: 

\textit{To what degree is the stabilization of the inverted pendulum similar to the flight control of a rocket in the early stages?}
\bigbreak
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Is the model of the inverted pendulum is similar rocket's flight control?
\item Can the inverted pendulum and the rocket be controlled using similar control methods?
\end{itemize}
