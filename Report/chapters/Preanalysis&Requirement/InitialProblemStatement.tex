\chapter{Initial Problem Statement}
In order to design and implement a controller that can ensure a stable launch and flight of a rocket the following questions needs answering: 

\textit{How is it possible to counteract the instability that occurs during launch and flight of a rocket, and how can rocket instability be defined.}\todo{Should Be Changed - Mathias}
\bigbreak
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item What factors contribute to an unstable rocket launch and flight?
\item Can the rocket be modelled based on another system with similar instability problems?
\end{itemize}
