%The following describes the hardware connected to the inverted pendulum setup illustrated cf. figure \ref{fig:InvertedPendulumSetUp}.
\newpage
Each part will be described with its specifications and use in the setup. The input and output relations of each block are illustrated on \autoref{fig:DCMotorRelation}, where the goal throughout the chapter will be to determine the transfer functions describing these relations.

\subsubsection{DC Motor}\label{DCMotor}
An Axem DC servo motor model F9M2 is attached to the gears to create an angular velocity in the system. The integrated tachometer of the motor is used as feedback to ensure control precision. Which is done to give the possibility to sample the velocity and direction of the motor and relate it to the position of the arm. Using the DC motor also means implementing a motor controller. Already implemented in the setup is a Maxon Escon 50/5 Servocontroller, which can be controlled trough PWM \cite{datasheet:maxon}. The servocontroller is supplied trough a 230 V regulator that can supply the servocontroller with up to 56 V and 15 A depending the power supply. The regulator in itself will be considered a blackbox, because of user limitations when working with 230 V at the university. The DC motor and servo controller will, in system diagrams, be evaluated as one unit, but further considered when implementing a system controller.

\subsubsection{Gear System}
Between the DC motor and arm is the gear system. The goal of the gear system is to reduce the ratio between the rotation of the motor versus the arm. The gear system is series of six gear, three small and three big connected with belts. The setup is seen on \autoref{fig:InvertedPendulumSetUp}, where the number of gear is illustrated. The parameters of the gear system is listed in \autoref{GearSystemParameters}.

\label{GearSystemParameters}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\hline
Piece & Parameter & Value & Unit \\ \hline
Gear$_{big}$ & Teeth & 40 & {[}1{]} \\
Gear$_{big}$ & Diameter & 0.12 & {[}m{]} \\
Gear$_{small}$ & Teeth & 12 & {[}1{]} \\
Gear$_{small}$ & Diameter & 0.04 & {[}m{]} \\
Belt & Length & 0.6 & {[}m{]}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Stick and Arm}
The goal is for the arm to apply force on their common joint, which would affect the stick's orientation around its center of gravity. The physical parameters for the stick and arm are listed in \autoref{DimensionsStick}.

Stick$_{short}$ & Length    & 0.4   & [m]    \\
Stick$_{short}$ & Weight    & 0.170 & [kg]    \\

Feedback is needed to be able to control the stick through the arm and gears. The sensors used are an integrated part of the setup, and the choice of these will not be further discussed.

A necessary feedback to take in account is the angle between the stick and arm. The angle between the stick and arm is detected and sampled from a potentiometers rotational position. Equally the position of the arm is needed to detect its angle. The position of each potentiometer is shown with boxes on \autoref{fig:InvertedPendulumSetUpPotmeter}.

The basics of each system in the inverted pendulum is now described with its specifications, and the dynamics of the system can be modelled. Each section will be modelled from the output to the input as the sections generate a torque that affects the previous sections of the system.
