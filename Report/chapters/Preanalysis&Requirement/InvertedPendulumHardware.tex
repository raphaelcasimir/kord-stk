%The following describes the hardware connected to the inverted pendulum setup illustrated cf. figure \ref{fig:InvertedPendulumSetUp}.
Each part will be described with its specifications and use in the setup. The input and output relation of each block is illustrated on \autoref{fig:DCMotorRelation}, where the goal throughout the chapter will be determining the transfer functions that describe these relations.

\subsubsection{DC Motor}
An Axem DC servo motor model F9M2 is attached to the gears to create an angular velocity in the system. The integrated tachometer of the motor is used as feedback to ensure control precision. This is done so it is possible to see the velocity and direction of the motor and relate it to the position of the arm. Using the DC motor also means implementing a motor controller. Already implemented in the setup is a Maxon Escon 50/5 Servocontroller, which can be controlled trough PWM \cite{datasheet:maxon}. The servocontroller is supplied trough a 230 V regulator that can supply the servocontroller with up to 56 V and 15 A. The regulator in itself will be considered a blackbox, because of user limitations when working with 230 V at the university. The DC motor and servocontroller will in system diagrams be evaluated as one unit, but further considered when implementing a system controller.

\subsubsection{Gear System}
Between the DC motor and arm is the gear system. The goal of the gear system is to reduce the ratio between the rotation of the motor versus the arm. The gear system is series of the same size small and big gear connected with belts. The setup is seen on \autoref{fig:InvertedPendulumSetUp}, where the number of gear is illustrated. The parameters of the gear system is listed cf. \autoref{GearSystemParameters}.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Stick and Arm}
The arm and stick are elements that always appears in the double inverted pendulum setup. The goal is for the arm to apply force on their common joint, which would affect the position of the stick. The physical parameters for the stick and arm is listed cf. \autoref{DimensionsStick}.

Some feedback is needed to be able to control the stick through the arm and gears. The sensors used are implemented as an integrated part of the setup, and will therefore be the choice and will not be further discussed.

A necessary feedback to know is the angle between the stick and arm. This is needed to balance the stick via the controller. The angle between the stick and arm is detected and sampled from a potentiometers rotational position. Equally the position of the arm is needed, this is to determine the amount of change needed to counteract the change in the stick. The position of each potentiometer can be seen \autoref{fig:InvertedPendulumSetUpPotmeter}.

The block diagram for the standard feedback control system with the known system plant is seen on \autoref{fig:FeedbackSystem}.

\todo[inline]{Might be changed, was not sure how we would handle the feedback of the sensors.}

The basics of each system in the Inverted Pendulum is now described with its specifications, and the dynamics of the system can be modelled. Each section will be modeled from the output to the input as the sections generate a torque that effects the previous sections of the system.
