\section{Controlling a Rocket's Stability}
The previous design method does not provide a perfectly stable attitude control. Indeed to have such precision an active control system is necessary. Full scale rockets use the thrusting force to achieve alike control. In order to do so most of them operate with the gimbaled thrust method. It consists of steering the engine's nozzle to get the thrusting force in right incidence, an example is seen cf. figure \autoref{fig:RocketGimbal}.

Where a torque is applied to create a rotation around the rocket's center of gravity. The thrust direction is relative to the position of the center of gravity.  This should compensate for direction deviations from the rocket's center line or trajectory, and keep the rocket stable.    	

However Space X introduces a new propulsion method by using multiple small engines instead of a big one. With this method the thrusting force direction can be instead controlled by the output of each engine. For smaller rockets orientable fins are used. By changing the orientations of the fins the drag and the lift are modified and so is the attitude of the rocket.


Stabilization of rockets are therefore feasible with different types of control types. Most rockets are one time use which means that implementing and testing of a stabilization system would be of high cost. Therefore will similar control systems be examined to research the possibility for making a ground based control system, which can be related to the motion and stabilization of a rocket in flight.
