\chapter{Introduction}
\textbf{Start with an explanation of why space exploration and orbitting technology is an advantage. Transition into how to put stuff in orbit or leave earth's gravity (rockets). Talk about issues with having basically a stick with thrusters beneath. It can tip over and variances in air currents have a large influence on the direction of the rocket. End with saying a control system that can make sure it's going straight is an advantage. Now we have a reason for making the control system we want.}

\section{Initial problem statement}
In order to design and implement a controller that can ensure a stable launch and flight of a rocket the following questions needs to be answered: 
\begin{itemize}
\item What makes a rocket unstable during launch and flight? \textbf{Spin, tilt}
\item Is there a system that has the same instability properties that is easier to test on? \textbf{Inverse pendulum}
\end{itemize}
