\section*{Method}
The procedure for the test is as following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Supply the sensor with 5 V and ground trough the input and output connection board in the yellow box. 
\item Attached the potentiometer of the arm to the voltmeter, the stick is not considered during measurement of the arm.
\item Use the spirit level to place the arm in vertical position which is the system's \SI{0}{\degree}.
\item Note the voltage.
\item Use the spirit level and protractor to place the arm in anti clockwise \SI{-45}{\degree} from vertical.
\item Note the voltage, and repeat earlier with \SI{-90}{\degree}, \SI{+45}{\degree} and \SI{90}{\degree} 
\item Place the arm in \SI{0}{\degree} and lock it.
\item Change the voltmeter to read the output from the stick potentiometer. 
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Raw data}
Voltages from each potentiometer are not expected to be the same. This is based on that the initial orientation of the potentiometers is not the same.

\section*{Data processing}
The main objective is to determine its outer limits and how much 1 V corresponds to in angle change. This can give the possibility to convert the analogue input on an Arduino back to the corresponding angle. 


It is shown that the linearity is acceptable and the proportional angle to voltage conversion is considered linear.
The conversion must be separated into two parts. This is done because the angle to voltage is different between the potentiometers.
To obtain a first order function the voltages and angles are plotted and approximated for both potentiometers.

\autoref{eq:armApprox} corresponds to a relation between the voltage to angle of the arm on figure \ref{fig:PotentiometerPlot}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:armApprox}
\theta_a\ =\ 63,64 \cdot \text{VPot}_{arm} - 117,77 \addunit{\radian}
\end{equation}


The plot is repeated for the potentiometer on the stick.

\end{figure}

\autoref{eq:stickApprox} that corresponds to a relation between the voltage to angle of the stick on figure \ref{fig:PotentiometerPlotStick}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stickApprox}
\theta_s\ =\ 66,66 \cdot \text{VPot}_{stick} - 170,46 \addunit{\radian}
\end{equation}

Sampling the sensor with an Arduino will be done through reading the voltage on an input. The voltage will corresponds to a proportional analog value from 0-1023, where 0 V = 0 and 5 V = 1023. Translating the voltages into angles can give us the backwards conversion. Considering that the value can take 1024 values then:
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{1024\ \text{units}}{5\ \text{V}} = 204,8\ \text{units/V}
\end{equation}     
Considering that the precision of the measurements and using an Arduino, all values would be rounded to the nearest integer.
The linear approximations might be calibrated during implementation to minimize offsets.
Further implementation is proceeded cf. section \ref{section:PotmeterImplementation}.

\section*{Conclusion}
The test concludes that it is possible to convert the voltage to values that can be used with an Arduino. The test also concludes that is able to keep the linearity of both potentiometers during conversions. The precision of the measurements shall be considered though.
