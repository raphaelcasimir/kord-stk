\section{Modeling of a Rocket}
The purpose of the system is to guarantee a stable flight to the rocket.

The modelling of the flight of a rocket can be divided into two equations: velocity and rotation. In this project, the desired trajectory of the rocket flight is considered to be on the zenith axis. This results in a vertical flight, with then a velocity on the same axis as the trajectory.The rocket's rotation is a circular motion on the bottom-to-nose axis. This create a centripetal force.

The displacement angle (gimbal angle) is the difference between the actual flight direction, or bottom-to-nose axis, and the zenith axis. Gimbaled thrust are controllable be used to create a torque and reduce the gimbal angle. 

In an inverted pendulum, the objective is to keep the stick in horizontal position. The angle difference between the horzental and the actual axis of the stick is measured in order to then create a compensation torque with the arm.

The arm as the same task as the gimbal thrust, and the horizontal axis is equivalent to the zenith axis.
The input of the closed loop is the gimbal angle (angle difference between actual flight direction and zenith axis) and the output is also the gimbaled angle. In the inverted pendulum, the input and output are also the angle differences (horizontal et actual axis).
